# Wumbo's Kiln Mod
Super basic Minecraft mod that adds a kiln block; it behaves like a blast furnace or smoker but accepts glass, terracotta, and stone recipes instead. Exists because I wanted to play around with modding and hate how long smelting glass takes in the early game in basically every pack I play.
